## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability in **SmartGate**, please follow these steps:

1.  **Do NOT open a public issue** on GitHub.
2.  Email the details to: devve52@gmail.com
3.  Include steps to reproduce the issue.

I will try to acknowledge your email within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix.

### What to expect
*   I am an individual developer, so please be patient.
*   This is an open-source educational project; there is no bug bounty (monetary reward) program.
